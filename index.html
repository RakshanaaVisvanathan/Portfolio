                <p>Code whisperer by day and bug hunter by night @ <a href="https://propelinc.com/">Propel</a>. I've spent the last year crafting logic, breaking stuffs and figuring out that "it works on my machine" isn't a valid excuse &#128514;. Completed my undergraduate journey in Computer Science Engineering, a path that I embarked upon despite not originating from a conventional computer science background. My love affair with technology began long before formal education, a seed planted in the fertile ground of curiosity and nurtured by an insatiable desire to understand the digital world. Allergic to semicolon errors, fluent in Python. Currently building things that (hopefully) make sense. Learning something new every time I hit run. I am eager to harness this intricate blend of theoretical insight and practical expertise to forge innovative solutions and contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape. With every line of code, I aim to push the boundaries of what is possible and explore the limitless potential of the digital realm.</p>

                <p>I was born in the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu into a middle-class family. Since my childhood, I excelled in everything I tried, from academics to extracurricular activities like singing, dancing, sports, and playing piano. My talents were evident to everyone around me. In the fourth grade, my computer teacher introduced me to the world of digital realm. He showed us how to do animations and edit videos using Movie Maker and taught us the basics of PowerPoint and MS Paint. This experience sparked a passion in me, though I didn't realize it at the time. I bought a computer and began making PowerPoint presentations, played games eventually becoming addicted to games. I often wondered how these games worked behind the scenes. I always thought i must develop some games that reflect my creativity.       
                    However, as I grew older, my interests shifted and temporarily got out of path. In high school, I chose to study biology and prepared for the medical entrance exams. Unfortunately, I became very ill and couldn't concentrate on my studies as much as I needed to. Despite performing well and securing a good score, it wasn’t enough to guarantee me a seat in a medical college in Tamil Nadu due to the fierce competition.            
                    I had a chance to get into a medical college in Himachal Pradesh through the ESIC quota, which was a golden opportunity. However, my parents were hesitant to let me go given my health condition. So, I decided not to pursue medicine and, instead, took up engineering, a field that initially held little appeal for me.               
                    At first, I felt lost and out of place. But life had other plans for me. I discovered a newfound passion for coding. The logical thinking and problem-solving skills I had honed during my NEET preparation proved invaluable in the world of programming. I threw myself into coding with the same determination I had shown in my pursuit of medicine, and it opened up a whole new realm of possibilities for me and now this is where I am....
